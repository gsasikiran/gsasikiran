  ## Thesis 📘 
  - [Automatic formative assessment of students’ short text  answers through feature extraction](https://github.com/gsasikiran/Automatic-Formative-Assessment)
      - Generate unsupervised automated feedback for students' short text answers based on the evaluator's question and desired answer
      - Provide feedback on interchange of topics, missed topics, missed terms, and irrelevant terms in students' answers
      - Use of natural language processing features,
          - Topic modeling
          - Information retrieval
          - Coreference resolution
          - Keyphrase extraction
          - Semantic similarity
      - Automatic and manual evaluation of the formative feedback system
